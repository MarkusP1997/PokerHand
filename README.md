# PokerHand
A program that computes which poker hand is better
In line 14-31 are some example hands that can be chosen in lines 32 and 33.
You can change the cards by changing the letters and numbers in line 14-31 or add new hands.
If both hands contain exact five cards the program will print out which hand is better or draw.
It doesn't check for doubled cards at the moment.
